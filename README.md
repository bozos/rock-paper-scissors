Rock Paper Scissors
===================

A simple web-app. Made with Firefox OS in mind.  
It is published at [Firefox Marketplace](https://marketplace.firefox.com/app/rps).

##TODO:
**(Arranged in descending order of Priority)**

* PNG fallback for Android Browser. This [Stack Overflow question](http://goo.gl/czmwVr) might help.
* Improving the scoring system, such that the game actually stops after some time.  
(Eg: If one player is ahead by 5 points)
* Add some CSS animation on button tap/click such that when the user taps his option, the image appears to go down into the plane.
* Add a start page with: Play, Help, Credits, Exit.
* Beautifcation of the app. Change the dull colorscheme.
